# HS Proposal Review (Public / De-identified)

This repo is a temporary, public, de-identified review surface so Luke can review proposal drafts remotely.

Rules:
- **No PII** (no addresses, client names, phone numbers, emails)
- **Text-only** (no PDFs, photos, zips)
- Use **Job Code** naming (e.g. `HS-YYYY-MM-DD-####`)

Content:
- `index.md` lists jobs
- Each job lives at `/<JOB_CODE>/` with:
  - `proposal-pack.md`
  - `pricing-journal.md`
